# Portfolio

This project is a **personal portfolio website** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It showcases my **skills, projects, education, certificates, and contact details** in a clean and responsive design.  
The site includes features such as a **dark/light mode toggle**, **typing animation**, and **scroll animations** to make it more interactive and user-friendly.
